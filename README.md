Amazon Sales Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon Sales data to understand sales performance, revenue trends, product category performance, and regional sales distribution. The analysis helps identify key business insights and patterns from the dataset.

Problem Statement

Businesses generate large amounts of sales data, but without proper analysis it is difficult to understand trends, top-performing products, and revenue patterns.

Solution

Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze sales trends and extract meaningful insights.
